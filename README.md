Tutorials for finding exoplanet signals in *Kepler* and K2 data, mostly using the PyKE package. These tutorials start from the *basics* in Chapter 1 and move up to more advanced tutorials on finding multiple planets, false positive rejection and TTVS. Tutorials are in the form of notebooks. All notebooks should work for python 2 and 3.

You can access the tutorials as notebooks in this repository, or as a [pdf](), or in the [PyKE documentation].
