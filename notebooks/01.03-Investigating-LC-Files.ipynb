    "In the previous notebook we looked at Target Pixel Files, which show how each individual pixel from the spacecraft behaved. Now we are going to look at a light curve file. There are two ways to access these. You can either generate them yourself from a TPF or you can download them from MAST. The ones on MAST have been built from TPFs by summing up the pixels in the aperture and correcting for spacecraft systematics and cosmic rays. They are also smaller in file size than the TPFs.\n",
